# Bangla-sign-language-Translator
 Abstract— 
 
The human body communicates through
various meaningful gestures, with sign language using hands
being a prominent example. Bangla Sign Language Translation
(BSLT) aims to bridge communication gaps for the deaf and mute
community. Our approach involves using Mediapipe Holistic to
gather key points, LSTM architecture for data training, and
Computer Vision for real-time sign language interpretation with
an accuracy of 94%.
